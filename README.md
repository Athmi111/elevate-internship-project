This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** using Python, Streamlit, and TMDB API. It applies cosine similarity to suggest top 10 similar movies based on user selection. The system fetches real-time posters and displays results in a 2x5 grid layout, providing an interactive and visually appealing recommendation experience.
